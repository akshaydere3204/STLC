# STLC

STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) is a step-by-step process followed in testing to ensure that the software is working correctly and is free of bugs. It is a part of the SDLC but focuses only on testing.

STLC Phases (Step-by-Step)
1. Requirement Analysis â€“ Understand what needs to be tested by analyzing requirements (from SRS, BRD).
2. Test Planning â€“ Create a test strategy, decide tools, estimate time, and assign tasks.
3. Test Case Design â€“ Write detailed test cases and prepare test data.
4. Test Environment Setup â€“ Prepare the testing environment (servers, databases, software, etc.).
5. Test Execution â€“ Run the test cases and report defects if any.
6. Test Closure â€“ Analyze results, create test reports, and document lessons learned.

Document required in the each stage of STLC

1. Requirement Analysis Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) â€“ Maps test cases to requirements for complete coverage.
Software Requirement Specification (SRS) â€“ Used to understand what needs to be tested.
Business Requirement Document (BRD) â€“ High-level requirements to understand user expectations.

2. Test Planning Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Test Plan â€“ Includes scope, testing approach, schedule, roles, risks, and required tools.
Effort Estimation Document â€“ Estimates time and resources needed for testing.
Risk Assessment Report â€“ Identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies.
3. Test Case Design Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Test Scenarios â€“ High-level descriptions of what will be tested.
Test Cases â€“ Step-by-step instructions, expected results, and test data.
Test Data Preparation Document â€“ Details on required data for testing.

4. Test Environment Setup Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Test Environment Setup Guide â€“ Steps to configure the testing environment.
Test Environment Checklist â€“ Ensures all necessary components (databases, tools, servers) are ready.

5. Test Execution Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Test Execution Report â€“ Summary of executed test cases, results, and status.
Defect Report/Bug Tracker â€“ Lists identified defects, their severity, and resolution status.
Test Logs â€“ Records details of executed tests for tracking and debugging.

6. Test Closure Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Test Summary Report â€“ Overall test results, defects found, test coverage, and pass/fail status.
Lessons Learned Document â€“ Insights on what worked well and what can be improved.
Closure Report â€“ Final approval and sign-off on testing completion.
